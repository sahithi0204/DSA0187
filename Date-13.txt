EASY PROGRAMS:
1)Write a C++ program to declare and initialize a constant integer with value 10. 
 
2)Write a C++ program to demonstrate the use of integer, float, and character data types.
 
3)Create a C++ program to declare an integer variable and a float variable, then assign the integer variable to the float variable.
 
4)Implement a C++ program that performs an implicit conversion from integer to float.
 
5)Write a C++ program to declare and initialize two integer variables and perform addition using the + operator
 
6)Create a C++ program to demonstrate the use of if-else control structure to determine if a number is even or odd
 
7)Write a C++ program to declare an array of integers and display its elements using a loop.
 
8)Implement a C++ program to demonstrate the use of switch-case control structure to display the name of the day based on the user input (1-7).
 
9)Create a C++ program to calculate the area of a rectangle using user input for length and width
 
10. Write a C++ program to find the maximum of three numbers using conditional statements
 
Medium
1)Write a C++ program that calculates the area of a circle. Use a constant variable for the value of pi and prompt the user to enter the radius. Display the calculated area.
 
2. Develop a C++ program that reads two numbers from the user, one integer and one float. Perform division of the float by the integer and display the result. Ensure proper type compatibility and implicit conversion handling.
 
3.Write a C++ program to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. Use logical operators and appropriate control structures to implement the leap year logic.
 
4. Create a C++ program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle as floating-point numbers, and display the calculated area
 
5. Develop a C++ program that reads an integer from the user and checks if it is an odd number. Use bitwise AND operator and handle implicit conversion properly
